\subsection*{Exercise one}
Suppose that a qualitative analysis rates the following risks as below.

\vspace{5mm}

\begin{tabular}{l c c}
	Security Event & Event Probability & Resulting Harm \\
	Web Site Defacement & Medium & Low \\
	XSS Attack & High & Medium \\
	Buffer Overflow on Web Server & Low & High \\

\end{tabular}

Rate these risks from highest to lowest priority.

\emph{
\begin{enumerate}
	\item XSS Attack
	\item Buffer Overflow 
	\item Defacement
\end{enumerate}
}




\subsection*{Exercise two}
A web site generates \$25,000 per hour in revenue. The probability of a web site outage in any given year is 10\% and such an outage would last 2 hours and cost \$1200 to correct. What is the Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE)?

\emph{Cost of outage:} $ (\$25,000 * 2 $ hours$) + \$1200 = \$51,200$

\emph{Probability of outage in a given year:} $0.1$

$ALE = cost * probability = \$51,200 * 0.1 = \$5,120$

\emph{Note: Some of our discussion around this in class was a bit muddled, so slightly different answers were accepted.}

\newpage

\subsection*{Exercise Three}
A small consulting firm works on one project at a time and stores project data on a single server. The value of this data is \$100,000 and a server failure would jeopardise up to 90\% of it. The probability of such a failure in any year is 0.20.  What is the ALE?

$ALE = cost * probability = (0.9 * \$100,000) * 0.2 = \$18,000 $
\vspace{75mm}

\subsection*{Exercise Four}
You have a \$3 million data centre located in an area at risk of flooding. A major flood that would destroy the data centre occurs once every hundred years. Compute the ALE.

$ALE = cost * probability = \$3,000,000 * 0.01 = \$30,000$

\vspace{60mm}

Based on this ALE, would you recommend that the company spend \$35,000 per year to control this threat?

\emph{No. The cost to control the threat exceeds the cost of the threat.}
