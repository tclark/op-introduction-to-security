\title{Cross Site Scripting: Lab Exercise\\ IN618 Security}
\date{}
\maketitle

\section*{Introduction}
In this lab you will exploit a cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in a
web application.  The application is online at \url{http://xss.foo.org.nz/lab3.2/}.  The
site requires the user to supply a username and password, but any username/password combination
will work.  The user's browser is then issued a cookie that is checked on subsequent pages.

On the next page the user is presented with a text box.  Anything entered into that
box is written out on the next page.  This application has basically the same XSS
vulnerability that we explored in the first lab.

\section{Tasks}
Your task is to demonstrate two exploits of the XSS vulnerability:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Capture a session cookie from a logged in session.
		The cookies are unique to each sesssion, so you 
		cannot just use the same cookie value that someone
		else captures. You may demonstrate that you have captured the session
		cookie by displaying its value in an alert box.
	\item Use XSS to alter the display of a web page in a nontrivial 
		way, i.e., you can't just pop an alert box.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Submission}
You will submit two JavaScript files, one for each exploit listed above. You
will also submit a text file explaining how each one works.  Include the captured session 
cookie value in that file. These files are to be placed in your home directory on a server set up for this lab.
Your lecturer will supply login credentials. This server also provides a web-accessible location you may want to use for launching your exploits.

You may consult with other classmates about the exercise, but the submitted materials 
must be your own.  No credit will be given for copied work.


The example code from the previous lab will be helpful.

\section{Marking}

There are 10 marks for this exercise:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Capturing a session cookie with XSS: 3 marks;
	\item Altering the display of an exploited web page: 3 marks;
	\item Explanation of the exploits: 4 marks.
\end{itemize}
